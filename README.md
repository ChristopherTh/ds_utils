This package has two purposes: automate and provide provide an easy interface to ds methods.

Examples:
Wrap statsmodels glms implementation -> Automatically generate all kinds of diagnostics plots

Dummy estimators creates a lower bound on common error metrics. Useful at the start of the analysis before using more sophisticated models.
